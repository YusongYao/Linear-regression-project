# Linear-regression-project

In this project, linear regression models are built to fit the airplane dataset which contains 13750 instances, where each instance is a set of 40 features describing the airplane's status. Our goal is to use these features to predict the `Goal` column, which is a command that our controller should issue. We will make our predictions by implementing linear regression.
